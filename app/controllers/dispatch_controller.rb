# We have a problem: every page type has a different controller.
# This means that we either have to declare the controller somehow
# in the route, or use a special dispatch controller that will pass
# on the request to the page's controller.
#
# We have it set up so that we can do both. A static route would look like:
#
#   /groups/riseup/wiki/show/40/
#
# A route using this dispatcher would look like this:
#
#   /riseup/title+40
#
# The second one is prettier, but perhaps it is slower? This remains to be seen.
#
# the idea was taken from:
# http://www.agileprogrammer.com/dotnetguy/archive/2006/07/09/16917.aspx
#
# the dispatcher handles urls in the form:
#
# /:context/:page/:page_action/:id
#
# :context can be a group name or user login
# :page can be the name of the page or "#{title}+#{page_id}"
# :page_action is the action that should be passed on to the page's controller
# :id is just there as a catch all id for extra fun in case the
#     page's controller wants it.
#
#
# TODO: I think the dispatchController breaks flash hash. Fix it!

  #
  # Suppose two groups share a page. Only one can be the owner.
  #
  # When linking to the page from the owner's home, we just
  # do /owner-name/page-name. No problem, everyone is happy.

  # This makes it so the banner will belong to the non-owner and it will not
  # be jarring click on a link from the non-owner's home and get teleported to
  # some other group.
  #
  # In order to make this work, we need the second query that includes all the
  # group participation objects.
  #
  # It is true that we could just do without the first query. It makes it slower
  # when the owner is not the context. However, this first query is much faster
  # and is likely to be used much more often than the second query.
