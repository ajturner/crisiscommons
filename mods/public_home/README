PublicHome
==========

This mod uses the site home as a first landing point before logging in.
This way the sites content is also accessible for people who do not have
a login yet.

Adjustments
-----------

* I adjusted this so that public_home can be configured per site. For this
  the included migration needs to be run:
    script/generate plugin_migration public_home && rake db:migrate
