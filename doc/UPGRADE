0.5.0 
-----

* To upgrade:

  1. Disable the application, put up a temporary down-for-maintenance page

  2. Make a backup of all of your files, and your database!

  3. Save the following files: config/database.yml, config/secret.txt, 
     config/crabgrass.[production|development|test].yml, and the following
     directories: log, assets, and any changes you may have made to the 
     stylesheets in the public directory.

  4. Replace everything else with the code from this release

  5. There are some new dependencies, make sure you have the compass
     library installed, the susy compass plugin, and version 2.2.20 or
     newer haml installed before continuing.

  6. Run plugin migrations, you may not have any but this is safe to do:
       % RAILS_ENV=production script/generate plugin_migration

     If a plugin migration file is generated (something like
     *_moderation_to_version_8.rb), then
     convert_message_page_to_discussion_message migration needs to be
     renamed so that it runs after the moderation migration.  to do
     this, simply move the message_page migration to a timestamp later
     than the moderation migration.

  7. Run migrations:
       % RAILS_ENV=production rake db:migrate
    
  8. Locations have been added! 
     
     Locations require an import of data files from Geonames
     (geonames.org).  By default, a smaller data set will be imported,
     consisting of cities with a population greater than 1000 people.

     Locations require a rake task:
       % rake cg:import_geo_data

     Please note that the cg:import_geo_data rake task could take a
     bit of time to run and will add a large-ish data set to mysql. 

     If you do not wish to import this data, you can skip this step
     and not use geo-location.

  9. Re-enable the application, taking down your temporary page.

  10. Review any Custom Appearances:
     
      Due to the change in the UI, custom appearances will need to be
      re-done after an upgrade. Custom Appearances are set in the
      Advanced tab of the Site Appearance settings.  The masthead
      background color will work as before, but any other changes using
      this form will not be applicable to 0.5.


0.4.7
-----
* Contains a migration that removes duplicate daily trackings.
  Due to a bug hourlies where counted twice for dailies. This
  migration fixes that. It only removes duplicates for the same
  page and day - so it should be a no-op if there are none.
  If you use trackings differently than on a daily basis you will
  probably not want to run this migration. Just remove it. It does
  not have any effect on the schema.

* Contains a migration that sets the access level of status post
  activities so that they are able to be viewed by friends and
  peers only.  This does nto have any effect on the schema.

To perform these migrations:
    % rake db:migrate RAILS_ENV=xxxx

0.4.6.1
-------

* the following is only necessary if you were running 0.4.6:
    % backup your database!
    % run the rails console: script/console production
    % Wiki.find(:all, :conditions => 'body RLIKE "[\r\n]{20,}"').size
      If it returns a zero, no need to do anything more
    % Wiki.find(:all, :conditions => 'body RLIKE "[\r\n]{20,}"').each
      {|w| w.body.gsub!(/[\n\r]{20,}/, "\n\n\n\n"); w.raw_structure = nil;
      w.save!}
    % repeat the first Wiki.find procedure to make sure you get no results

0.4.6
-----
* if using moderation module, a db migration is required:
    % script/generate plugin_migration
    % rake db:migrate
